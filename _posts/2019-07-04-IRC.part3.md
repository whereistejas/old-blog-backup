## What is ZNC (and, BNC)?
ZNC, is an advanced IRC bouncer that is left connected so an IRC client can disconnect/reconnect without losing the chat session. A BNC (short for Bounced Network Connection) is a piece of software that is used to relay traffic and connections in computer networks, much like a proxy. Basically, ZNC will act as a bridge between our client and the IRC server.

ZNC offers some strong features, listed below:
1. **Modules** - Modules are used to extend and modify the way ZNC functions. Modules can be `perl`, `C++` or `python` scripts. They can be added on global, per-network or per-user basis.
2. **Multiple Users, Networks and Clients** - That's pretty self-explanatory. Interestingly, an `admin` can limit the max no. of networks that an user can connect to.
3. **Playback Buffers** - When you attach to ZNC, ZNC playbacks all the conversations that took place while your client was detached. Not only this, it also remembers which channels you joined and left, all of this is also reflected in other clients.
4. **SSL Support** - Always needed.

## How do we setup ZNC?
This needs to occur in four steps:
1. Install `znc` on your server. The word 'server' is very important here. ZNC needs to be installed on a machine that is always running and always connected to the internet. Once the ZNC service is started, you never have to worry about it again, except when your server shuts down.
2. Generate an initial config file using `znc --makeconf`.
3. Configure your ZNC setup using the `znc webadmin`.
4. Configure your IRC client to connect to ZNC.

## Step 1: Install ZNC on your server.
In my own setup, I use a VM (Compute Engie) running on Google Cloud Platform. This particular costs me absolutely nothing. I suggest everyone who is a student to join the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). They provide you with AWS and Digital Ocean credits. 

It is advised that you run ZNC over a seperate port, in which case you will be required to modify the firewall settings.

You can find the firewall settings in the VCP Networks submenu.

To do so in GCP you will need to create a new firewall rule. Also, you will need to enable both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` protocols on your VM. After, enabling the port, we will have to install `znc` and `znc-dev`. We need `znc-dev` in order to install and build modules.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install znc znc-dev
```
