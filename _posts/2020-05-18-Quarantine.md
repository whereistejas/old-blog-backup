I guess, I just wanted to address the elephant in the room. We may blame the current difficulties in our lives on the pandemic or the resulting quarantine, but the truth is that life is always difficult. More often than not, the satisfaction you gain from putting in effort is always less than the effort. This is a game where we are always on the losing side and entropy is always on the winning side. I don't know how to make joy last, or even make the memories of that joy, last. But, amidst this utter chaos and madness, there is beauty. We must learn to see that beauty from time to time. The odds of a ship's survival in stormy seas, are only as good as the willingness of the helmsman to not give up.
