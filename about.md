My name is Tejas. I code, read and write. I never paint, dance or sing. I, mostly, code in python for fun and mostly, solve problems related to physics. I have thing for numerical computations and simulations. As far as my work is considered, I code in ABAP for SAP-based applications. Once upon a time, I used to be an open-source evangelist, urging people to use open-source or free software, in every way that they could. I am a great believer in Linux as the perfect personal OS. I have been using Fedora as my daily driver for years. I try my best to not use proprietary software. But, sometimes it's very difficult not to. I used to use Firefox, but I found the plugin ecosystem so-so, at best. Customising the browser, is damn near impossible. So, I switched to palemoon (a fork of Firefox). It was much more customisable, but it was an absolutely horrible user experience. Nowadays, I use Vivaldi. I love it. It's awesome. I'm an avid podcast listener. My favourite pocast is Freakonomics.

You can find me on IRC (Freenode) by the nick `whereistejas`.
