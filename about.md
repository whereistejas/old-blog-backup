My name is Tejas. I code, read and write. I never paint, dance or sing. I, mostly, code in python for fun and mostly, solve problems related to physics. Recenlty, I have taken an interest in [Rust](https://github.com/whereistejas/rust-practice). I have a thing for numerical computations and simulations. As far as my work is considered, I code in ABAP for SAP-based applications. Once upon a time, I used to be an open-source evangelist, urging people to use open-source or free software, in every way that they could. I have been known to shove FOSS down people's throat, at times (just kidding, maybe... ?). I am a great believer in Linux as the perfect OS. I have been using Fedora as my daily driver for years. Recently, I moved to Ubuntu (late, 2020) because of the better GPU support for NVIDIA. I try my best to not use proprietary software. But, sometimes it's very difficult not to. I used to use Firefox, but I found the plugin ecosystem so-so, at best. Customising the browser, is damn near impossible. So, I switched to palemoon (a fork of Firefox). It was much more customisable, but it was an absolutely horrible user experience. Nowadays, I use Vivaldi. I love it. It's awesome. I'm an avid podcast listener. My favourite podcast is [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/archive/) and [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes).

Special Mention: I use vim. Here are my [dotfiles]().

I usually takes notes about everything and I have decided to share all of them on Github. [Here](https://github.com/whereistejas/notes) is that repository. 

You can find me on IRC (Freenode) by the nick `whereistejas`.
