## structure and characteristics
1. the double pendulum is a normal pendulum with another pendulum attached at it's end.
2. the dynamics of the double pendulum depend on the following characteristics:
	1. the length of the limbs
	2. the mass of the limbs
	3. the angle at which the limbs are suspended before being released into motion.

## nitty-gritty
we will get to the equations that describe of this system.

the ultimate goal of this simulation is to predict the position of the limbs with respect to time.

so, assuming that the fixed point of the limb is the origin of a cartesian coordinate system.
